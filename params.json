{"name":"More Than A Museum","tagline":"","body":"# The Andy Warhol Museum\r\n\r\n## Digital Strategy: 2015 - 2017\r\n\r\nThis is a versioned digital strategy repository for [The Andy Warhol Museum](http://www.warhol.org) in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. The strategy is designed to grow with the museum through technology's rapid evolution and be a living resource the museum can use to navigate the fast-moving and often uncharted waters of the emerging digital landscape.\r\n\r\nWe are using GitHub to draft and publish this strategy, which makes a catalog of previous versions accessible. In addition, the source files can be easily shared and repurposed within the cultural sector. We intend to revisit and update this strategy regularly as tactics and technologies evolve.\r\n\r\nTo read the strategy in a browser, [start here](index.md). You can also download your own copy in MarkDown format for your off-line reading pleasure.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis digital strategy was authored by Jeffrey Inscho, Manager of Digital Engagement at The Andy Warhol Museum, in close collaboration with:\r\n\r\n* Eric Shiner, Director, The Andy Warhol Museum\r\n* Patrick Moore, Managing Director, The Andy Warhol Museum\r\n* Rachel Baron-Horn, Director of Finance and Operations, The Andy Warhol Museum\r\n* Edward Motznik, Vice President of Information Technology, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh\r\n* Jessica Warchall, Assistant Communications Manager, The Andy Warhol Museum\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about the digital strategy can be sent to [awm-webmaster@warhol.org](mailto:awm-webmaster@warhol.org).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis strategy repository is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0](LICENSE.txt) license.
